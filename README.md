# Snake-Water-Gun-Game.
// The Snake-Water-Gun game is a fun and engaging take on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It blends simplicity with randomness, offering endless replayability. Players choose between "Snake," "Water," or "Gun," and the computer makes its own choice. The outcome is determined by the following rules:

// Snake drinks Water (Snake wins against Water).

// Water destroys Gun (Water wins against Gun).

// Gun kills Snake (Gun wins against Snake).
// Run this game in vs code Terminal
